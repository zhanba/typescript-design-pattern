## Structural Design Pattern

* Composite: Builds tree-like structures using primitive and composite objects. A
  good example would be the DOM tree that forms a complete page.
* Decorator: Adds functionality to classes or objects dynamically.
* Adapter: Provides a general interface and work with different adaptees by
  implementing different concrete adapters. Consider providing different database
  choices for a single content management system.
* Bridge: Decouples the abstraction from its implementation, and make both of
  them interchangeable.
* Fa√ßade: Provides a simplified interface for the combination of complex
  subsystems.
* Flyweight: Shares stateless objects that are being used many times to improve
  memory efficiency and performance.
* Proxy: Acts as the surrogate that takes extra responsibilities when accessing
  objects it manages.
